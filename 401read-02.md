# Reading Notes
## Unit Tests and Documenting

### Unit Tests

* Unit testing isolates specific units of code.
* A unit in C# is a method. 
* XUnit article explains the steps to set up and run in VS.


### Documenting

* README is always in all caps, since the UNIX days. Just the way it is.
* The intent is clear: "This is important information for the user to read before proceeding." 
* A long, boring README is almost as bad as no README at all.
* Your job is to: tell them what it is (with context)
* show them what it looks like in action
* show them how they use it
* tell them any other relevant details
