# OOP Readings
## Review of Readings

_Things I Understand Better Now_

* After first reading, a lot of the prework didn't make a lot of sense, especially Big O notation. Now that we have incorporated it into our whiteboarding and code challenges, it resonates more. 
* General syntax for C#, the more I work with the code, the more I realize that we are learning a new way to write things that we have already learned, as in arrays. 
* I/O - conceptually, it is a lot easier to understand than the readings would have us believe.
