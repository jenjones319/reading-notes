# Reading Notes

## Hash Tables

* Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
* Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
* Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

* Hash Maps can have any number of buckets. 
* This would be an O(N) read operation because it requires searching through each piece of data to find the one piece we want.
* Hash maps take advantage of an arrayâ€™s O(1) read access.
