# Reading Day 3

## June 16, 2020

__Chapter 3: Lists__
* ordered lists use the ol tag
* unordered lists use the ul tag
* both use li as list item.
* if creating an online glossary, that is a definition list. use the dl, dt, and dd tags to create. 
* to create a nested list, use the ul or ol tag inside an li
* lists are easy and fun.

__Chapter 13: Boxes__
* specifying the size of a box using CSS means defining pixels, percentages, ems. most of the time px is the best method. 
* CSS can also be used to set the min and max width, as well as min and max height. p. 305.
* you can control the overflow of content using hidden and scroll properties. 
* every box has border, margin, and padding that can be used to improve design and readability. Really good chart on 307-308.
* border-width, border-style, and border-color can also be adjusted. These 3 can be shorthanded inside the border property. 
* padding can also be shorthanded as top,right,bottom,left respectively. 

__Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops__
* if else statements are conditional. if the if statement is false, the else statement block is executed.
* switch statements give you multiple options. illustrated on 164. 
* falsy and truthy statements are treated as if they are false or true. **I don't quite get this part.**
* for loops run a specific number of times checking for a condition, usually with a counter.
* while loops keep running as long as the condition is true.
* do while loops run curly brace statements at least once, even if the condition returns false. 
* for loops using the counter as a condition will use var i=0, i<10, and i++. p. 171 details the definitions. 
* the standard statement is for (var i=0; i< 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}
* for loops are generally used to loop through an array.
* while loops are used repeating a block of code while a condition is true. 
* do while loops - **I still don't understand what this does.** I need an example of its practical use on a site. 
* example code for a loop inside an if statement is on p 180,181.
