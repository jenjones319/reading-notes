# Reading Notes

## API Hooks

* Hooks are js functions that are fully encapsulated. 
* useState and useEffect are hooks. 
* useEffect lets us perform side effects inside components. It renders every time it runs.
* can only call hooks from React function components.
* can only call hooks at top-level, not inside loops or conditions, etc.
