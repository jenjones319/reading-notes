# Reading Notes
## Jquery, Events, and the DOM

_Notes from Duckett_

* JQuery makes it easier to select elements, perform tasks, and handle events.
* When we create a selection with JQuery, it stores a reference to the nodes in the DOM tree.
* With JQuery we can update elements and add content, also remove content. 
* Can also change CSS rules and respond to events. 
* document.write can be used to add a new script. 

_Pair Programming_
