# Reading Notes
## Razor Pages

* Razor Pages is a new aspect of .NET Core. It makes coding pages easier.
* Razor folders have: A .cshtml file that contains HTML markup with C# code using Razor syntax AND A .cshtml.cs file that contains C# code that handles page events.
* Supporting files have names that begin with an underscore. For example, the _Layout.cshtml file configures UI elements common to all pages. 
* With Razor Pages, when you make a request (e.g. /contact) the default ASP.NET Routing configuration will attempt to locate a Razor Page for that request in the Pages folder.
