## The Call Stack

* A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

* We start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

* At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

* Types of JS errors: reference errors, syntax errors, range errors, type errors.
