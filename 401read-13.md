* Services can be injected into the Startup constructor and the Startup.Configure method.  Only the following services can be injected into the Startup constructor when using the Generic Host (IHostBuilder): IWebHostEnvironment, IHostEnvironment, IConfiguration
* a repository encapsulates a set of objects stored in the database and operations that can be performed on them, use one repo class per aggregate: hotels, rooms, students, etc.
