# Readings #3
## System I/O

* System I/O means input, output.
* Reading, writing, or seeking are the 3 main streams.
* I should always do asynchronous I/O because I/O operations are resource intensive. 
* The read and write readings provide sample code for synchronous and asynchronous I/O methods and classes.
