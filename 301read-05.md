# Reading Notes
## Heroku Deployment

* This reading covers how to deploy Heroku for use with Node.js
* The other reading covers how to post a blog using heroku. 
* The deployment guide features a lot of terminology definitions, so a useful reference for understanding those labels in Heroku. 
* Both the blog and the Heroku link have links to other tutorials that can be used to better understand Heroku and Node.js.
