# Reading Notes
## Testing and Swagger

*  Swagger, also known as OpenAPI, solves the problem of generating useful documentation and help pages for web APIs.
*  "when the ProductController.Details() action is invoked, the Details view is returned." - Checking out the details property on these is very important. 
* Unit testing a part of an app means testing it away from its dependencies, etc. To do this, use a POST request in the HomeController. 
*  ActionResult<T> (ActionResult<TValue>) enables you to return a type deriving from ActionResult or return a specific type.
