# Reading Notes
## Sending Form Data

* On the client side in HTML file, the form tag, with the action attribute, as follows: <form action="https://example.com"> this goes to a completely new site. 
* this goes to a slightly different url <form action="/somewhere_else">
* OR, can use the GET method along with the action attribute on the form tag. Example: <form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
* retrieving data on the server side assumes using the POST verb in the HTML. 
* can also do the server side work in node and express.
