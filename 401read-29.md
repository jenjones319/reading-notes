# Reading Notes
# Policies

*  Role-based authorization and claims-based authorization use a requirement, a requirement handler, and a pre-configured policy
* Authorization can't occur when the claim is missing, in which case a completed task is returned. When a claim is present, the user's age is calculated.
* In those cases, you can use a custom IAuthorizationPolicyProvider to control how authorization policies are supplied.
* IAuthorizationRequirement is a marker service with no methods, and the mechanism for tracking whether authorization is successful.  Each IAuthorizationHandler is responsible for checking if requirements are met.
* Based on the examples in the reading, it seems to get used a lot for 21plus applications.
