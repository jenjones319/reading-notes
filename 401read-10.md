## Intro to ERDs
* DBMS is database management system. It typically includes end users, administrators, designers.
* Need to remember that with DBs in dotnet, CRUD is still a thing: Create, Read, Update, Delete. 
* Primary Key -  is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
* Foreign Key -  is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. 
* Composite Key -  An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key. 
* Schema is a blueprint/roadmap of how a DB is constructed.
