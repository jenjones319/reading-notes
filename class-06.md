__JS Chapter 3: Object Literals__
* with objects, variables become properties
* functions become methods
* properties and methods have key/value pairs. 
* properties and methods are keys. 
* creating an object using literal notation is the most common method
* you access the properties or methods using dot notation and square brackets. see . p. 103
* object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.


__JS Chapter 5: Document Object Model__
* Document Object Model (DOM) specifies the ways in which a browser should access objects, properties, and methods
* DOM is consider to be an API.
* DOMs have document, element, attribute, and text nodes.
* Accessing and updating the DOM tree: 1. access the elements, 2. work with those elements.
* DOM queries find elements in the DOM tree. This is how script finds the element in the DOM tree...
* getElementById('one');
* ways to select elements in the DOM tree are covered in pages 193-202. 
* When a DOM query can return more than one node, it will return a NodeList.
* In older browsers, DOM implementation is inconsistent. 
* Browsers contain tools for viewing the DOM tree.
