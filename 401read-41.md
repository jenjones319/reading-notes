# Reading Notes

## HTTPS security

* Need HTTPS for privacy, integrity, identification. 
* OWASP - Open Web App Security Project
* Integrity means the message wasn't altered before it arrived at its destination. 
* Salting is adding a string of text gibberish to the password. 
* GDPR-General Data Protection Regulation, which is much stronger in the EU than it is here.
