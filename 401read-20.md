# Reading Notes
## MVC

* Model: Strongly-typed views typically use ViewModel types designed to contain the data to display on that view.
* View: Uses the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup.
* Controller: Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render.
* ASP.NET Core MVC is built on top of ASP.NET Core's routing, a powerful URL-mapping component that lets you build applications that have comprehensible and searchable URLs. 
* Razor is a compact, expressive and fluid template markup language for defining views using embedded C# code.
