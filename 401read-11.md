# Reading Notes

## Stacks and Queues

* Stacks and Queues are not exactly a data structure more of a way to enforce policies. 
* Queues follow the first in first out logic (FIFO) like waiting in line. Also, then, last in last out. (LILO)
* Stacks follow first in last out logic (FILO), like a stack of plates in the cupboard. Also, then, last in first out. (LIFO)
* Can use arrays or linked lists with S/Q. 

* Stacks use three methods: push (put data on top of stack), pop (remove data from the top), or peek(look at data on top of stack). 
* Uses: stack of cards, books, etc. 


* Queues have three methods, too: Enqueue(put new data at the end of the queue), Dequeue(remove data from the beginning of queue) and peek(look at data)
* Uses: enforcing people take turns in a game, or waitlisting.
