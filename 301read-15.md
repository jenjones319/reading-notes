# Reading Notes
## Diversity and Inclusion

* The first article about Silicon Valley and various gaming toys being directed at boys, I thought that was very interesting.
* The article about the breakdown at companies - definitely very revealing. While I think that reflecting the population is important, what if these companies reflected their audience segments? 
* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative. Yes! Diversity also encourages innovation...
* This topic is really important as we go forward in this industry, and I am glad it's being addressed.
