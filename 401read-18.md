# Reading Notes

## Adding Identity

* This means user names and passwords, etc. 
* inside a .Net web application, you need to 'change authentication' to add user accounts. 
* the NuGet package is asp.net core identity. 
* 3 classes represent user identity: Claim, ClaimsIdentity, and ClaimsPrincipal
* claim class handles claims with two data types: type and value. 
* behaviors used in the auth system: authenticate, challenge, sign in, sign out, forbid.
