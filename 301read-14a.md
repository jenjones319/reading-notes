## Normalizing SQL dBs

* Reasons to normalize a db: simplify queries, avoid duplicates, avoid data mod issues.
* Anomoly types: Insert, update, delete
* There are 3 common forms of database normalization: first - every column has unique data; second - every column has unique data tied to the primary key; third - all columns are not dependent on the primary key. 
* What duplicated info does: increase storage and decrease performance; make the db difficult to update accurately.
