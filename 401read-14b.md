# Reading Notes
## Binary Trees

* Two ways to traverse trees: Breadth or Depth first.
* Pseudocode for traversal method: ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)

* New nodes can go anywhere. 
* The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n). 
* The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree. For example, in the above tree, w is 4.
* A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. 
* The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Treeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height)
* The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1). During a search, we are not allocating any additional space.
