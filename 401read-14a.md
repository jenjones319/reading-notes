# Reading Notes

## MVC Routing

* When creating a new MVC Routing method, don't touch these: the system.web.httpModules section, the system.web.httpHandlers section, the system.webserver.modules section, and the system.webserver.handlers section.
* The Default route maps this URL to the following parameters: controller = Home, action = Index, id = 3. Want a different result? Need to supply different parameters. 

## .Net Routing

* Routing uses middleware and endpoints. 
* An ASP.NET Core endpoint is:

* Executable: Has a RequestDelegate.
* Extensible: Has a Metadata collection.
* Selectable: Optionally, has routing information.
* Enumerable: The collection of endpoints can be listed by retrieving the EndpointDataSource from DI.
