_Introduction_
* Discusses how the book is structured and how people access the web. 
* HTML sets the structure of a page, CSS sets the style.

_Chapter 1: Structure_
* HTML: Characters inside angled brackets are *elements*. Usually include an opening and closing 'tag.'
* Tags act like containers. 
* Attributes are specitic aspects of elements. The information contains a name and a value, like this: lang="en-us"
* Key components of any page are: <html> <head> <title> <body>
  
_Chapter 8: Extra Markup_
* Covers doctype <!DOCTYPE html>, comments <!-- -->, id attributes to elements, class attributes to elements, block elements ul, li, inline elements <img>
* div groupings for blocks, span which is div for inline elements.
* <iframe> which is a window to another page. An example is a google map. 
* <meta>. <meta> lives in the <head> element.
* escape chars, which is all the funky stuff like copyright and ampersand.

_Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout_
* New elements in HTML5, including article, footer, header, nav, and aside. 
* Also, section, hgroup, figure, figcaption, how div is used now
* _Question? p. 442 contains css that the book recommends to include in pages to help older browsers. Should we do that?_ 
* Example HTML5 on p.444 could be helpful reference.

_Chapter 18: Process and Design_
* This chapter goes through site maps, wireframes, target audiences, why people visit, and what they want to do on our site=all good for site architecture planning. 
* Also covers visual hierarchy, grouping, similarity, size, color, style, and images. 

_Javascript: Intro + Chapter 1: ABCs of Javascript_
* Javascript personalizes the user experience. You can use .js to access content, modify content, set a list of steps to perform, or react to events. 
* When writing a script: 1. define the goal; 2. design the script; 3. code each step
* Objects are things. could be a car, hotel, shoes, soda pop. 
* Objects have properties. Then each property in the car would have a name (make, model or brand, flavor) and a value (ford, explorer or fanta, orange).
* Events are things that happen. (duh.) A hotel would have reservations, check-ins, stays, cancels. So would an airline.A gift card would have purchases, funds added or subtracted, balance checks.  
* Methods are things people do with the object, ways people interact with it. They are expressed like this: makeBooking(), checkAvailability(). Or maybe a gift card would have checkBalance(), addFunds().
* Document objects generate new content into the HTML page. including write() and getElementById(). document.write() is used a lot. 
* Use the <script> element in the HTML page to tell the page where to find the .js file.
