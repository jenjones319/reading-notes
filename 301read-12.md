## EJS Partials

* Partials are similar to functions. THey help continue the HTML code across views. 
* The example given in the article is using different nav bars for different views such as home or contact us. 
* Here is how to use a partial: use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
* To create partials, you create a new ejs file for each partial. NAV_FILE for example.
