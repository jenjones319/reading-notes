## Responsive Web Design and SMACSS

* RWD means a site changes based on the viewport available.
* Floats and Containers are used a lot to create rwd's.
* SMACSS guidelines keep our css organized. Five css sheets are used: body, layout, modules, states, and themes. 
* Grids are also used in RWD to organize site content.
